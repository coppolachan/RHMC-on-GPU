1. Features
-----------

Performs Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo simulation of QCD with  N_f flavors
of staggered (non improved) fermions. 
Except some minor functions, all the calculations are performed using
NVIDIA gpus, implementing a CUDA version of all the relevant kernels 
(Dirac operator, Dirac operator inversion, gauge and momenta update).

See the following reference for more details:
'QCD simulations with staggered fermions on GPUs'

2. Compilation
--------------

The typical compilation follows the pattern:

./configure && make

this will compile a code to run in a single core CPU.

3. Enabling CUDA routines
-------------------------

In order to enable CUDA routines type the following command (also look at the 
variour options in 'configure --help')

./configure --enable-cuda=ARCH

where ARCH should be substituted by one of the following strings "sm_XX" 
in order to choose the target NVIDIA architecture

sm_10  ISA_1, Basic features
sm_11  atomic memory operations on global memory
sm_12  atomic memory operations on shared memory, vote instructions
sm_13  double precision floating point support (Tesla Cards)  
sm_20  Fermi architecture support

please refer to the original NVIDIA documentation for more details on which
cards support the several architectures.

4. Issues
---------

Some newer compilers, like GNU gcc 4.5, are incompatible with the NVIDIA nvcc
compiler (CUDA 4.0). In order to solve this problem you should install a different 
version of the compiler, e.g. gcc 4.4, in the directory PATH_TO_COMPILER and then
configure with the following command

./configure --enable-cuda=ARCH --with-cuda_comp=PATH_TO_COMPILER \
             CXX=PATH_TO_COMPILER/g++ CC=PATH_TO_COMPILER/gcc

(where the '\' is just a carriage return to be omitted in the actual command).

5. Known bugs
-------------

Please report any to the developers.
